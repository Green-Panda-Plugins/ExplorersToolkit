## Explorer's Toolkit
Changes the way players explore, encoraging navigation without using F3.

## New Items

### Player Compass
The player compass is a new item that lets you track online players who also have a player compass.
You can craft the player compass with a compass and 8 amethyst shards.

## Navigation Changes

### Lodestone
The lodestone gets a new crafting recipe. Instead of costing a netherite ingot, the new crafting recipe uses a compass and blackstone. It also gets a new texture, which reflects the new recipe.

Lodestone compasses also get a quality of life change. The coordinates of the block they are tracking is displayed under the item name. Right clicking on the item in your hand also shows the coordinates in your action bar. If the lodestone is destroyed, it will remove the coordinates from paired compasses.

### Maps
Right clicking on a filled map will show your current coordinates, as long as you are within the confines of the map.

## Settings

### F3
It's highly reccomended to use this plugin with the gamerule "reducedDebugInfo" set to true, which hides coordinates on the F3 screen. You can also use other plugins to hide the location on modded clients.
