## Player Compass

The player compass is a new item that can be used to track other players on a server. Other players must also have a player compass in their inventory for you to be able to track them. When tracking a player, the location you are tracking won't update until you use the item again. Only the 10 closest players will be shown to track.

## Obtaining
You can craft the player compass with a compass and 8 amethyst shards.
